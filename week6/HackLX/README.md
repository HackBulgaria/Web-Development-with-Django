Your task is to create a small system for offers.

Here are some mockups: https://app.moqups.com/meco/FYpHUL2OUu/view/page/ad64222d5

Keep in mind:
- You have handle the media file upload
- You have to optimize you calls using django-debug-toolbar
- You have to use Bootstrap to make the system look good.

Rewrite all views using class-based-views.

Add a new `DetailView` for every offer.

This is the first edition of the Web development with Django course in HackBulgaria.

Throughout the course we'll be learning Django fundamentals and we will develop production-ready code.

## Versions

We will stick with the latest versions of Python (`3.5` / `3.6`) and Django (`1.10` / `1.11`).

## Course Program

The duration of the course is 9 weeks including 16 lectures:

* Refreshing Python knowledge
* Basic lifecycle of Django application and it's components - models, views, templates
* Django unit testing
* ORM specifications - relations, inheritance, unique togethers, querysets, statements, F and Q statements
* Django views - request's lifecycle. Middlewares, Request & Responses, Generic Views.
* Django Forms and Django templates - gathering data from users 
* Authentication with Django
* Django Rest Framework. Creating APIs
* Introduction to Celery as task runner for async tasks
* Implementing payment providers.
* Deployment of your Django application


## Prerequisites

* This course is NOT for beginners - Python experience is required.
* Frontend knowledge (HTML / CSS / JavaScript) is optional. We won't dive into that.

## Problems for preparing

In order to prepare yourself (if you need to) for the course, you can solve the following problems, from our last "Programming 101 with Python" course:

* [Everything from week01](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101-Python-2016/tree/master/week01) - small Python functions to warm you up.
* [Money in the bank from week11](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101-Python-2016/tree/master/week11/01-Money-In-The-Bank) - this problem is about refactoring an existing codebase in order to make it more secure. SQL is involved.
* [Decorators from week10](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101-Python-2016/tree/master/week10/Decorators) - a very important Python concept.
* [Generators from week12](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101-Python-2016/tree/master/week12/01-Generators) - another very important Python concept.

# Week 3 - Models, templates & forms.

## Useful template things

* [DTL guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/templates/language/)
* [Template inheritance](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/templates/language/#template-inheritance)
* [`{% include %}`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/templates/builtins/#include)

## Forms

Django has a very powerful abstraction over HTML forms - <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/forms/>

They are very useful for doing validation.

If you want to create a form for a given model, you can try model forms - <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/forms/modelforms/>
